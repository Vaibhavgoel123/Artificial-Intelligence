# Foundations of AI
**AI** or **Artificial Intelligence** is the technology in which we train the machine to learn from the environment so as to reduce human workload as there are various tasks which can be done by the machine in more 
efficient way as compare to human like repeated tasks which can be automated for daily basis so that the person instead of engaging in some repeated task, can focus on other productive tasks.  
## Types of AI:
1. Narrow AI:  
   It was designed for some specific tasks and most of the AI models in recent are Narrow AI models.
   They are also known as Weak AI models. They are mostly referred to as automating a specific task.
2. Strong AI:  
   It can perform intellectual tasks just like a regular human mind can perform.
   It is highly typical to develop only till now, but in future we can achieve this also.
   It is just like replicating a human mind. It is also known as General AI.
3. Super AI:  
   It can surpass the human intelligence but it only exists in science fiction for now.
